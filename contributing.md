# Contributing to CrazyCrates
Contributions to the project are always welcome, Pull Requests do have some guidelines before being approved.

## You should always create the fork as a personal repository not in an organization.
Any pull request made by a fork in an organization prevents modifications. Everyone has their own way of doing things and rather asking you to change that. A personal fork lets us change the things
that we have a tick about. 

If you do not use a personal fork, We have to manually merge your pull request which means it's marked as closed instead of merged.

## Requirements
* `git`
* Java 21 ( Adoptium or Corretto is recommended )

### Pull Requests must be labeled properly according to if it's a bug fix, a new feature or enhancements to the code base.
* `git checkout -b fix/your_fix`
* `git checkout -b feature/your_feature`
* `git checkout -b quality/your_enhancement`
* Commit your changes using `git commit -m 'your commit'`
* Push to your branch using `git push`

### What's next?
* Send a pull request to the `dev` branch.

You must explain what your pull request is changing and if needed, Supply a video of your change as Pull Requests are a way to get feedback.

## Api Additions
Additions to our API are much more delicate as they can directly impact end users much more than adding a new feature or fixing a bug.

Adding new methods is perfectly fine as it won't break current plugins depending on our plugin. Replacing methods is also fine as long as you keep the old around but deprecated.

Under no circumstance is existing methods suppose to have a change to the variables in the methods. You can change anything inside the method.
 * i.e. UUID cannot become Player in `getKeys`, You should create a new method and deprecate the old one.

If trying to expose internal hashmap's or arraylists using the API, Return an unmodifiable version of the map/arraylists
