### CrazyCrates Github Flow
In order to ensure the stability of my sanity when handling this repository, and version tabbing. I am writing an essay for my future self.

**You must not UNDER any circumstance commit to the main branch** All changes should be made via a pull request.

* You should only *version bump* when you are *ready* to release.
* The commit when version bumping should always be separated, and clearly labeled like `v0.0.1 Update`
* All work should be done in a properly labeled branch.
  * If you find you are fixing a bug, label the branch as fix/bug_desc
  * If you find you are adding a feature, label the branch as feat/feat_desc and so on.
